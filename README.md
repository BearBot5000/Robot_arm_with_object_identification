Overview
This project combines robotic arm control with object identification using computer vision. The goal is to enable a robotic arm to detect, identify, and interact with various objects within its environment.

Features
Control a robotic arm using ROS 2.
Object identification using OpenCV and machine learning.
Integration with Gazebo for simulation.
Real-time feedback and visualization.
Requirements
ROS 2 Humble LTS
Gazebo
OpenCV
Python 3.8 or later
TensorFlow Lite (for running machine learning models)
Installation
ROS 2 and Gazebo
Follow the official installation guides for ROS 2 Humble and Gazebo.

Python Dependencies
Create a virtual environment and install the necessary Python packages:

bash
Copy code
python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
Cloning the Repository
Clone this repository and navigate to its directory:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/BearBot5000/Robot_arm_with_object_identification.git
cd Robot_arm_with_object_identification
Usage
Running the Simulation
Launch the Gazebo simulation:

bash
Copy code
ros2 launch my_gazebo_worlds world.launch.py
Run the object identification node:

bash
Copy code
ros2 run object_identification identify_objects.py
Control the robotic arm:

bash
Copy code
ros2 run robot_arm_control arm_controller.py
Real Hardware
For real hardware, ensure all connections are secure and the ROS 2 environment is set up correctly. Adjust launch files and scripts as necessary.
